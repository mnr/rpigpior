```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

*-bash: gpioset: command not found*

You are probably running a lite version of the operating system. This doesn't have the `gpiod` library installed. That's easy to fix...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gpiod libgpiod-dev

```
