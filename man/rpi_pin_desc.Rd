\format{
\subsection{\code{rpi_pin_desc}}{

A data frame with 40 rows and two columns:
\itemize{
\item description. Primary function of the pin
\item secondary. Secondary function of the pin
\item valid_PWM_pair_1, valid_PWM_pair_2. Used by rpi_pwm() to determine valid PWM pins and channel combinations.
\item PWM_channel. Unambiguously relates the PWM channel to each board pin
}

rpi_pin_desc

\description{
A board-level description of the 40 GPIO pins found on a Raspberry Pi.
This is different than wiring pi or BCM numbering schemes. Instead, this reflects the function of pins by their physical location on the board.
