\title{Retrieve the value of a RPi Pin}
\usage{
rpi_get(pin_number)
}
\arguments{
\item{pin_number}{a Raspberry Pi GPIO board level pin number between 1 and 40. For example, Pin #1 is located upper left and provides 3.3 volts. Pin #40 is located lower right and is the location of GPIO21.}
}
\value{
named vector with the value of each pin number.
}
\description{
Returns the value of one or more specified board-level pin number (0-40). Stops if the pin is not a valid data line.
