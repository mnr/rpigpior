`rpigpior` allows the R programming language access to the Raspberry Pi
GPIO using libgpiod. Because libgpiod is already included in Raspbian,
there is nothing else to install.

`rpigpior` provides these tools:

-   `is.rpi` - Returns TRUE if this code is running under Raspbian
-   `rpi_get` - Returns the value of a board level pin (1-40) or an
    error if the pin isn't a data line (3.3v, 5v, or GROUND)
-   `rpi_set` - Sets a pin to on or off
-   `rpi_monitor` - watches a pin for a number of rising or falling
    events
-   `rpi_pwm` - provides diagnostics and support for hardware pulse
    width modulation
-   `rpi_i2c_get` - retrieve a value from an i2c connection
-   `rpi_i2c_set` - set an i2c register to a value

## Installation

`rpigpior` is hosted on github. Until it arrives at cran, you can
install the development version of rpigpior from
[GitHub](https://github.com/mnr/rpigpior) with:

``` r
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("mnr/rpigpior")
```

Most documentation will tell you to use devtools, but
`install.packages("devtools")` on a Raspberry Pi is an onerous task.

Once you've installed, use `library` just like any other R package:

``` r
library(rpigpior)
```

## Is this a Raspberry Pi?

It's helpful to check if your code is running on a Raspberry Pi.

``` r
if ( is.rpi() ) {
   print("Yes, this is a RPi")
} else {
   print ("No, this is not a RPi")
}
```

## Reading a pin

If you connect a switch to board pin 40, this code will read it:

``` r
library(rpigpior)

rpi_get(40) # reads board pin 40
rpi_get(c(7,40)) # reads board pins 7 and 40

> GPIO004  GPIO21
        0       1
```

That assumes the switch to board pin 40 is "pushed" or closed. By the
way, there is a diagram of this located in the *articles* section of the
website (as identified in the package description)

## Turning pins on and off

If you have a LEDs connected to board pin 19, 21, and 23, this code will
turn them on, then one of them off, then all of them off

```         
library(rpigpior)

toggleThese <- c(19,21,23)
rpi_set(toggleThese,1)
Sys.sleep(1)
rpi_set(toggleThese, c(1,0,1))
Sys.sleep(1)
rpi_set(toggleThese, 0)
```
