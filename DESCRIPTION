Description: This provides R with access to the Raspberry Pi General Purpose 
    Input Output (GPIO) via 'libgpiod'. This includes detecting a gpio chip as 
    well as turning pins on and off via [gpioset()] and reading the state of pins 
    via [gpioget()]. No additional libraries need to be installed; Raspbian includes 
    'libgpiod' as part of the standard installation.
